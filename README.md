[using MouseMoved]

https://editor.p5js.org/Josephine003/full/eJe0m2mwP

## Task
[] Sketch using 2D primitive shapes, loops, and random numbers <br>
[] write your own functions and make calls to these functions in your code <br>
[] experiment with at least one new item from the https://p5js.org/reference/

## Notes
coding principles : variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and objects

<three key elements in loops>
- variable / while (x<width)
- exit condition / rect(x,200,23,80)
- increment station / x+=50

<function>
defining : setup / draw
calling : createCanvas / background / fill / noStroke <br>
<br>
Q. why do we need functions? <br>
A. modularity / reusability

## Process and Experimentation

working with loops

<br>
<br>
I wanted to try another one, so I tried a new item, mousemoved. I had an idea to make circles follow the mouse as it moved.

It was working as different as I have intended so I have used the chatgpt to figure out the problem of my codes.<br>
<br>
My prompt : " How do I need to fix the codes to get the circles to follow when I move the mouse?

chatgpt : To make circles continuously follow the mouse movement, the background should not be cleared every frame. If the background() function is called inside the draw() function, the canvas will be overwritten repeatedly, causing previously drawn circles to disappear. To prevent this, the background should be set only once or the background call should be removed. <br>
